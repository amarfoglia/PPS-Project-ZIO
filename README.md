# PPS-Project-ZIO

![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/amarfoglia/PPS-Project-ZIO?label=Release)

The repository contains the report for the exam of the "Paradigmi di Programmazione e Sviluppo" course (2020-2021). The research topic focuses on the [ZIO](https://zio.dev/) which is a purely functional, type-safe, composable library for asynchronous, concurrent programming in Scala. The report explores the fundamental features of the library using snippets and a final demo.

## Why ZIO

ZIO is also a valid solution in the business context as it allows the development of highly scalable, performing and resource-safe applications. In addition, the ZIOâ€™s type-safe Scala compiler can catch bugs at compile time and allow to develop concurrent app avoiding deadlocks, race conditions, or complexity. Finally its functional, simple building blocks provide rapid solutions to complex problems.

## Project resources
